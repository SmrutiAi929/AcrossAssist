# ✅ Good News: Your API Key Works!
# ⚠️ But You've Exceeded Your Quota

## Current Status:
- ✅ **API Key is VALID** - Connection is working!
- ❌ **Quota Exceeded** - You've hit your usage limit

## Error Message:
```
You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.
```

## What This Means:
Your API key is working correctly, but you've used up your available quota. This could be:

1. **Rate Limit** - 60 requests per minute (free tier)
2. **Daily Quota** - Monthly/daily usage limit reached
3. **Billing Issue** - Some features require billing to be enabled

## Solutions:

### Solution 1: Wait and Retry (Free Tier Rate Limit)
If you hit the **60 requests/minute** limit:
- ✅ **Wait 1-2 minutes**
- ✅ **Refresh the page** and try again
- ✅ The quota resets automatically

### Solution 2: Check Your Quota Usage
1. Go to: **https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard**
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Select your project
4. Check the **"APIs & Services"** → **"Dashboard"**
5. Look for **Gemini API** usage

### Solution 3: Check Billing (If Needed)
1. Go to: **https://console.cloud.google.com/billing**
2. Make sure billing is enabled for your project
3. Check if you have any quotas enabled

### Solution 4: Check API Status
1. Go to: **https://aistudio.google.com/**
2. Check your API usage there
3. See if there are any restrictions on your account

## Free Tier Limits:
- **60 requests per minute**
- **1,500 requests per day**
- No credit card required for basic usage

## If You Need More Quota:
1. **Wait for reset** - Quotas reset periodically (usually every minute/day)
2. **Enable billing** - Allows higher quotas
3. **Upgrade plan** - Get more quota

## Quick Fix - Wait and Retry:
1. **Wait 2 minutes** (let the quota reset)
2. **Refresh your browser** (F5)
3. **Try again** - it should work now

## To Monitor Your Usage:
- **Google AI Studio**: https://aistudio.google.com/
- **Cloud Console**: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard

## ✅ Summary:
Your API key is **VALID** and working! You just need to wait for the quota to reset or check your quota limits in the Google Cloud Console.
